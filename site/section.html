            <h1>What is the point of Valorant?</h1> 
            <p>Valorant is an objective-based game Attacking teams are trying to plant the spike, so defeating all the enemies does mean they win the round. But defending teams can still lose rounds even after killing their opponents, if they don't defuse the spike in time.</p>

            <h1>Is Valorant a good game?</h1>
            <p>It's quick, fun, and a great way to either warm up for the main event or simply to experience Valorant without stressing out. Unfortunately, if you want to look cool in Valorant, it's going to cost you a lot of money. Free-to-play games typically sell cosmetics to make a profit, and this is the case with Valorant.</p>

        <section id="section3">
            <h1>How many GB is VALORANT?</h1>
            <p>The game's actual full size comes in at between 14 and 20 GB â€” positively minuscule compared to other shooters. Part of this is undoubtedly Riot's intention to have Valorant running on as many PCs as possible.</p>
